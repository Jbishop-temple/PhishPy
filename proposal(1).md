# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PhishPy



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Python command-line tool that connects to your email to detect and analyze possible phishing threats.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

SO for my project I want a program you can run on your computer that will connect to your email and look for posisble phishing email. I would want the porgram to be ran almost like an application, so make it like a executable. Once ran there would be a text based interface that would give you a few options but first you would input your email information. Then you would be prompted with 2 options; one to analyze a specfic email in your inbox to determine whetehr its spam or not. The other option is to scan a bunch of emails in your inbox and highlight the ones that may be spam. Ideally I would want a way to delete the emails marked as potentional phishing emails. ALso maybe even a analysis on why the program believe it to be spam.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

If I cant create a program that can connect to someone email and jsut pull emails and display I think that would be a win.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My ideal/better outcome is actually getting my program working and in a finished state.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My beest outocme is not only having myprogram wokring but adding eztra feature like possible deleting the phishing emails or maybe having it automated

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I want to learn a bit about bash scripting, also more about imap, pop, and general email settings, and lastly more general python skills
